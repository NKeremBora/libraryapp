# Library App

## ðŸ“– Information

**Authentication:**

All users must register before accessing book borrowing, returning, or administrative endpoints. Upon successful login, the system issues an access token and a refresh token using JWT. A dedicated endpoint is provided to refresh tokens when the access token expires. Logging out will invalidate the refresh token, effectively terminating the session. Role-based access is enforced through Spring Security, ensuring that sensitive operations are restricted to authorized roles. The system responds with appropriate HTTP status codes: 200 for successful operations, 400 for invalid input, 401 for unauthorized access, and 409 for resource conflicts such as duplicate entries.

**Book Management:**

Librarians are responsible for adding new books to the system. Each book entry includes details such as the title, author, ISBN, publication date, and genre. All inputs are validated before persistence to ensure data integrity. Both librarians and patrons can view detailed information about books and perform searches using filters like title, author, ISBN, or genre. All search operations support pagination to handle large result sets efficiently. Book updates and deletions are restricted to librarian users. Duplicate ISBNs are not allowed and will result in a 409 Conflict.

**User Management:**

The system allows users to register by submitting personal information including name and contact details. Upon registration, each user is assigned a role: either PATRON or LIBRARIAN. Librarians have elevated permissions, which include viewing, updating, and deleting other usersâ€™ profiles. Role-based access controls ensure that patrons cannot perform administrative operations. Authentication is mandatory for all protected resources, and access rights are evaluated using JWT tokens.

**Borrowing and Returning:** 

Patrons can borrow available books, with the system recording both the borrowing date and the due date. Before completing the borrowing operation, the system validates that the book is available and that the patron is eligible to borrow more books. Returning a book updates the system to reflect the bookâ€™s availability and closes the borrowing record. Users can view their personal borrowing history at any time, while librarians have the ability to access the full borrowing history of all users. The system also tracks overdue books and allows librarians to generate detailed reports for follow-up actions.
